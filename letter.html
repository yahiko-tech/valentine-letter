      He fell in love with her without ever meeting her, without knowing how her
      voice sounded in real life or how her smile looked under the sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet somehow, he knew her heart—the way she cared, the way she existed
      gently in a loud world.
    </p>

    <p>
      He loved her quietly and completely, not because she was his, but because
      she was her.
    </p>

    <p>
      His love asked for nothing in return; it simply stayed, patient and
      unconditional, even from a distance.
    </p>
